# LogicArena-Î±

A self-hostable web platform for natural deduction proof duels and puzzle solving.

## Overview

LogicArena allows students to:
- Practice natural deduction puzzles in a self-paced environment
- Compete in real-time duels to solve proofs against other players
- Track progress through an Elo rating system

Proofs are written in Fitch-style notation and verified by the Carnap proof-checker with SAT validation.

## Architecture

The system is composed of several microservices:

- `gateway`: FastAPI-based API gateway with JWT authentication and WebSocket support
- `front`: Vue 3 + Vite frontend with a Monaco-based Fitch editor
- `match`: Redis-backed matchmaking system for duels
- `puzzle`: Puzzle generation and verification service
- `proof-checker`: Carnap + minisat proof validation service
- `rating`: Elo rating system

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LogicArena.git
   cd LogicArena

   Edit the `.env` file to set your JWT secret and other configuration.

3. Start the services:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Initialize the database:
   ```
   docker-compose exec gateway python init_db.py
   ```

5. Access the application at http://localhost:3000
