# LogicArena

LogicArena is a web platform for natural deduction proof duels and practice. This project allows logic students to practice formal proofs and compete against each other in real-time duels.

## Features

- **Puzzle Drill**: Solve auto-generated natural deduction puzzles at your own pace
- **Blitz Duel**: Compete against other players in real-time proof battles
- **Fitch-style Proof Editor**: Write and verify proofs in a familiar notation
- **Elo Leaderboard**: Track your progress and compare with other players

## Architecture

LogicArena is built as a microservices application with the following components:

- **gateway**: FastAPI-based API gateway with JWT authentication and WebSocket support
- **front**: Next.js frontend with Monaco-based Fitch editor (optimized with Bun for 3x faster builds)
- **match**: Redis-backed matchmaking system for duels
- **puzzle**: Puzzle generation and verification service
- **proof-checker**: Carnap + minisat proof validation service
- **rating**: Elo rating system

### ðŸš€ Performance Optimizations

- **Bun Integration**: Frontend builds are 3x faster using Bun runtime
- **Optimized Docker Images**: Multi-stage builds with caching
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic chunk optimization for faster page loads

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- (Optional) [Bun](https://bun.sh) for faster local development

### Quick Start with Bun (Recommended)

For the fastest development experience:
```bash
./scripts/dev-with-bun.sh start
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LogicArena.git
   cd LogicArena
   ```

2. Start the services:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Initialize the database:
   ```
   docker-compose exec gateway python init_db.py
   ```

### Database Migrations

LogicArena uses a migration system to manage database schema changes. 

#### Running Migrations

To apply all pending migrations:
```bash
docker-compose exec gateway python migrate.py migrate
```

#### Creating a New Migration

To create a new migration file:
```bash
docker-compose exec gateway python migrate.py create "Add new feature"
```

This creates a timestamped migration file in `gateway/migrations/`.

#### Rolling Back Migrations

To rollback the last migration:
```bash
docker-compose exec gateway python migrate.py rollback
```

To rollback a specific migration:
```bash
docker-compose exec gateway python migrate.py rollback 20250106_000001_add_google_auth
```

#### Checking Migration Status

To see which migrations have been applied:
```bash
docker-compose exec gateway python migrate.py status
```

4. Access the application at http://localhost:3000

### Development

For development, use the development Docker Compose file:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

## Proof Verification

Proofs are verified using the Carnap proof checking system, which supports Fitch-style natural deduction. The proof checking service validates the syntax and deduction rules. For invalid sequents, a minisat-based SAT solver is used to generate countermodels.
